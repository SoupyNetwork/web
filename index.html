        <p>I'll disappear (I'll disappear)</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's like the world I knew keeps passing</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the void I have become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Picking up pieces left from another life</p>
        <br>
        <p>This fleeting memory is everything you left behind</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm just a whisper, just a specter locked away in time</p>
        <br>
        <p>This purgatory is eating away at my mind</p>
        <br>
        <p>Left to wander, left to dissipate</p>
        <br>
        <p>Without you I will never be the same</p>
        <br>
        <p>Left to confide insecurity</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you disappeared you took a part of me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I see you over and over</p>
        <br>
        <p>Far beyond me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm drifting away</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even inside a dream</p>
        <br>
        <p>This world has no meaning</p>
        <br>
        <p>And after all that I've done</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all of my pain</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all that I've become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Will I disappear, disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like a ghost in the breeze?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like fading memories</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like the world you left was only just a dream</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I'll disappear, I'll disappear, I'll disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's like the world I knew keeps passing</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the void I have become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Letting go of perfection, another lie</p>
        <br>
        <p>This wretched melody is everything you left to die</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm just a vacuum, just a fragment, an echo in time</p>
        <br>
        <p>This purgatory is eating away everything</p>
        <br>
        <p>Left to suffer, left without your place</p>
        <br>
        <p>Without you I will never be the same</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let me see you one more time</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you disappeared you took a part of me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I see you over and over</p>
        <br>
        <p>Far beyond me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm drifting away</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even inside a dream</p>
        <br>
        <p>This world (this world) has no meaning</p>
        <br>
        <p>And after all that I've done</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all of my pain</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all that I've become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Will I disappear, disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like a ghost in the breeze?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like fading memories</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like the world you left was only just a dream</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I'll disappear, I'll disappear, I'll disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all that I've done</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all of my pain</p>
        <br>
        <p>This fucking world disintegrates (I'll disappear)</p>
        <br>
        <p>And after all that I've done</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all of my pain</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all that I've become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Will I disappear, disappear (disappear)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like a ghost in the breeze?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like fading memories</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like the world you left was only just a dream</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I'll disappear (disappear)</p>
